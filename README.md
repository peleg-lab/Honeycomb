# Honeycomb construction under geometric frustrations

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repo provides the code for the computer vision pipeline used to analyze honey bee experimental data for the paper 
"Crystallography of honeycomb formation under geometric frustrations". The pipeline primarily includes automatic 
honeycomb cell detection on the 3D printed experimental frames, recunstructing the honeycomb cell structure using 
Voronoi diagram, and classifiying them based on the number of sides/neighbors. It also contains the code for a 
computational model that reproduces the patterns identified in the experimental data through a simulated annealing 
process in which the minimized potential is a variation of the Lennard-Jones potential that only considers 
first-neighbor interactions according to a Delaunay triangulation.

## Data

The repo also consists of imgae crops of comb built on our 3D-printed frames under various  geometric frustrations. 
Along with the csv files that contain the coordinates of the centroids of the cells that are automatically detected on 
every image crop.
