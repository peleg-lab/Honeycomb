# Honeycomb construction under geometric frustrations

This repo provides the code for the computer vision pipeline used to analyze honey bee experimental data for the paper 
"Honeycomb crystallography in comb formation under geometric frustrations". The pipeline primarily includes automatic 
honeycomb cell detection on the 3D printed experimental frames, recunstructing the honeycomb cell structure using 
Voronoi diagram, and classifiying them based on the number of sides/neighbors.
